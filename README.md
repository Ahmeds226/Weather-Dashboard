# Weather-Dashboard

I have developed a weather dashboard so that it is easier for people such as travelers to view multiple cities at once so that they can plan their trip accordingly.

Within the application I:

1. Used the OpenWeather API to retrieve the weather data.
2. Utiised local storage to save search results even after being refreshed.
